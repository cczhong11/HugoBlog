# Hello World

This is my first blog and I want to express something I learned in my graduate year. CMU is a very great place and I could meet many clever and hard-working students in this place. I learn the latest technology and skills in this school, and I also gain many precious experiences here. 

## Spend time wisely

I believe I have a good time management skill and I could handle 4 courses in CMU in one semester. However, I still find I did not spend time efficiently and sometimes I just wasted my time. 

We need to write a lot of codes in CMU and it really requires me to think carefully when I run the code. In the past, I have a bad habit that I will run the program to test my code. Sometimes it will occur complie error because of my typo. These mistakes should be elimated before I run the code. I spent serval hours debugging some codes looks like right but having some impossible errors. **Reading codes line by line really is a must when we debug the code**.

Having an **aim** is very important when we need to do anything. If we do not think of what I expect to do in the first place, I believe you will not achieve your goal easily. When I begin to do something, think about what I what to achieve in the first place. Then I will focus on it for the whole time. After finishing it, check the result and my expectation. This is a very ideal flow, however it is not easy to implement in my daily life.

## Why I want to start the blog

In the past, I learned a lot from others' tech blog. Other people experience really help me learn new stuff and let me understand some difficult concept. I did not think it is necessary for me to open a blog because I did not have anything to write about. I could find answer easily by searching google.

However, I always want to open a blog to share my experience and learning. It would be great if I could share my learning with the world. Therefore I used Hugo and github.io open a self blog website. 

## What I will share here

- program learning
- cloud and distributed system learning
- Algorithm learning
